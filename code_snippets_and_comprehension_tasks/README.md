# Code Snippets & Comprehension Tasks

This directory contains the code snippets & comprehension tasks:

- **Code Snippets** as single Python files
    - given their original naming (`./code_snippets/original_naming/`)
    - final naming used in the paper (`./code_snippets/final_naming/`)
    - a mapping file that tracks the correspondences (`./naming_mapping.csv`)
- **Comprehension Tasks** as single Python files 
    - given their final naming (`./comprehension_tasks/`)
    - a config file containing answer options and the correct answer (`./comprehension_tasks_config.csv`)

*Please note that `10-177-V1/V2` are identical code snippet files that only differ in their comprehension task. Furthermore, we did not discard `./code_snippets/original_naming/10-181-V1.py`, although it has been discarded due to overlength and is therefore not included in the `./code_snippets/final_naming/` directory. We have also added the Interest Area files (`./IAs/`) for each code snippet, which may be required for preprocessing (e.g. when pre-computing embeddings for fixations).*
