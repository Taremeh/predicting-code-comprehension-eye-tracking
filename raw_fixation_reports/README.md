# Raw Fixation Reports

This directory contains the raw fixation reports generated by the EyeLink Software. There exists one fixation report per participant. For participants who took part in a second session an additional file with suffix "2" exists. However, as mentioned in section 3.5 of the paper, we had to discard 36 datapoints due to initially using a dark mode display which had led to inaccuracies in the recordings. The removal affected four of participants who participated in two sessions. Because we discarded their first session due to the dark mode display, there only exists one file (i.e. of the second session file).
